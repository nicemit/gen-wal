# Contributing to Gen-Wal

Thanks for considering contributing! This is a personal project, but I love seeing how others use it.

## How can I help?

1.  **Add a Profile**: Created a cool "Cyberpunk" or "Nature" profile? Submit a PR adding it to `profiles/examples/`.
2.  **Fix Bugs**: If something breaks on your distro, fixes are welcome.
3.  **Improve Providers**: Want to add a new Image Generator or LLM provider? Go for it.

## The Flow

1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create your branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-profile`)
3.  Commit your changes.
4.  Open a Pull Request.

## Philosophy

*   **Keep it simple**: We don't need a heavy database or GUI.
*   **Local-first**: Prefer tools that can run on the user's machine.

Happy hacking! 🧠
