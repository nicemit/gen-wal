# Deep Work Reference Frame

## Mindset Sources
- Atomic Habits (systems > goals, small daily actions)
- Deep Work (attention, distraction avoidance)
- The War of Art (resistance, showing up)

## Core Philosophy
The professional shows up every day. You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems. Focus is the new IQ.
