# Stoic Reference Frame

## Mindset Sources
- Meditations (restraint, impermanence, control)
- Letters from a Stoic (patience, time, discipline)
- Discourses (focus on what is in your control)

## Core Philosophy
We suffer more often in imagination than in reality. The obstruction to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.
