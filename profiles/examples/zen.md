# Zen Reference Frame

## Mindset Sources
- Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind (presence, simplicity)
- Tao Te Ching (non-forcing, patience)
- The Practice of the Wild

## Core Philosophy
In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few. Do nothing and leave nothing undone.
